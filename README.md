# Easy-Coding-Quiz
## Details
In this week's coding assessment, I was task to create and complete a multiple-choice questions coding quiz. This will help me expand my Javascript skills and review work on my existing HTML and CSS. As a new full stack web developer I will need to show my skills to any employer and will most likely need to create a similar assessment in an interview process.


# User Story

* SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
* THEN the game is over
* WHEN the game is over
